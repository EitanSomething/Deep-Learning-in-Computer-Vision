# Deep Learning in Computer Vision
### Description
Advances in deep learning have revolutionized the field of computer vision and are driving innovations in many fast-growing industries, notably driverless cars, autonomous robots, and AR, to name a few. In this project, we will begin with a quick introduction to convolutional neural networks and learn to work with Tensorflow, Googleâ€™s framework for developing and training ML models. Together we selected a common problem in computer vision, namely image classification and segmentation.

### The Team
Hey! Our team was made up of Yeshiva University students taking this special summer course in Industrial Software Development. Please make sure to check out our LinkedIns: [Tuvya Macklin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuvyamacklin/), [Zachary Mankowitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-mankowitz-a4a11324a/), [Eitan Traurig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eitan-traurig-3332b2261/), [Jason Zelmanovich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonzel/).

We couldn't have done this project without the generous help of our mentor [Gershom Kutliroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gershom-kutliroff-9a89611/). Gershom has been working in AI for over 15 years and was truley an invaluable resorce.

### Video Presentation
At the end of the course, we made a presentation with explanations of how and what we did to produce our results. Please feel free to see [our presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzgG1tagBnc) and [other groups](https://sacknovi.github.io/summer-2023/projects/teams.html#AI-1) who made projects too.
